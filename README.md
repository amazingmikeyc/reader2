# reader2

This is currently me playing around with Symfony and Angular JS to make a simple Google Reader type thing. It's currently a mess so please don't try to infer too much about my development style from this. This commit was just to get something on the screen.

Here's what I need to do to what I've got already:
 - Make the PHP code follow some PSR rules
 - Add in unit tests for both PHP and Angular
 - ~~Add in a nice Bootstrap or similar CSS template~~
 - ~~Use Bower and suchlike~~
 - ~~Replace that unfinished RSS parser (maybe fork it?)~~
 
And that's before adding in features
 - Save and load RSS lists
 - Validate
 - User accounts and log ins
 - More complicated RSS parsing to combine more than 1 feed
